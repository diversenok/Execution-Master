**Execution Master** is a program for Windows that allows you to configure any
program launch using several standard actions:

 - **Ask** user to confirm program execution;
 - **Deny** program execution (2 modes: notify user and not);
 - **Drop** administrative privileges of specified program;
 - Request **elevation** for the program at every launch;
 - Force system **not to sleep** / **display to be on** while selected prorgam works;
 - **Execute** another program instead of specified.

### Release content:

 - **ExecutionMaster.exe** — GUI tool for configuration;
 - **emc.exe** — console tool for configuration;
 - **Actions** folder with actions executables described above.

**Note:** if you have x64 version of Windows use x64 version of program.
Not all actions of x86 Execution Master will work correctly on Windows x64.

Program is still in beta. Was tested on Windows 7, 8 and 10.
